## 🛡️ **Moderation agents for marketplace content quality and safety**

These AI Agents can be used to keep product spaces clean and safe.
They can detect risky content, reduce manual review load and improve content quality before publication.

They are great tools for marketplace environments where high-volume user-generated content requires fast, consistent and scalable moderation.

### 🛠️ **Structure of each agent**

Each agent folder follows a consistent structure:

•	README.md – business context and how the agent works

•	engine – folder with automation setup and json template

•	prompt.md – core logics for the AI Agent

•	use_cases.md – real applications of the agent

These agents are built to:

•	reduce manual review time

•	catch risky cases earlier

•	improve content quality before it reaches users

•	standardize decision logic

•	support trust & safety teams with scalable automation
